 Exercise 1:
 Given the following dataset: wdbc.data.csv, ignore the first column (ID number), assign the
 second column to y and the rest of the columns to X. Scale your data using the Standardization
 method and perform Principal Component Analysis with PCA=2. Plot the 2 Principal Components
 and print the variance ratio. In addition, given the data point: dataPoint = np.array([
 7.76, 24.54, 47.92, 181, 0.05263, 0.04362, 0, 0, 0.1587, 0.05884, 0.3857, 1.428, 2.548, 19.15, 0.007189,
 0.00466, 0, 0, 0.02676, 0.002783, 9.456, 30.37, 59.16, 268.6, 0.08996, 0.06444, 0, 0, 0.2871, 0.07039]),
 plot it on the existing plot. In addition, using logistic regression, plot
 the decision boundary and predict the class to which the data point belongs. 

 Exercise 2:
 Given the following dataset: golf.csv, use Na√Øve Bayes classifier to predict whether a golf
 game will be played or not given the following three data points: [Rainy, Hot, High, True],
 [Sunny, Mild, Normal, False], [Sunny, Cool, High, False].
